For each of the following digital designs, please
(a) Construct its truth table;
(b) Show the minterm & maxterm expansions respectively;
(c) Show the equations of the simplified SoP & PoS respectively;
(d) Draw the simplified 2-level full-NAND and full NOR implementations respectively.
(e) Describe the full-NAND implement in (d) with Verilog structural modeling, using nand2(dout, d0, d1), nand3(dout, d0, d1, d2), nand4(dout, d0, d1, d2, d3), nand5 ...



A design that outputs logic “1” iff the corresponding decimal of its 4-bit **BCD** input {x3, x2, x1, x0} is prime.
