For each of the following digital designs, please
(a) Construct its truth table;
(b) Show the minterm & maxterm expansions respectively;
(c) Show the equations of the simplified SoP & PoS respectively;
(d) Draw the simplified 2-level full-NAND and full NOR implementations respectively.



A design that outputs logic “1” iff the corresponding decimal of its 4-bit binary input {x3, x2, x1, x0} is prime.
